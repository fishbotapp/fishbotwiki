## QUALITY OF LIFE
* Even when dark mode is enabled on https://fishbot.app/ , the frame for the Wiki tab always displays in light mode. <br> I looked for a .css file but couldn't find, so I think it's elsewhere.<img width="1914" height="907" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/c10d6bc2-6af9-474c-8bc3-a70b5e2cbee4" />

## BALANCE


## IDEAS / FEATURES
- Page on fishbot.app with widgets and stream and chat, a better way to play

## LONG TERM / PIE IN THE SKY
- Widget above ported to iphone app / android app / windows app
- Fishbot bank u could use via website (deposit/withdraw) so ur inv can be managed/cleaned
