# Master Sets

### Obtaining 

Master sets contain 5 items: head, chest, legs, gloves and boots.
They are a guarenteed drop from a Master crate. The piece you receive will be random.

These items are top tier, endgame bangers with great stats and effects... thus the high requirements to get them.

Master crates are made via !make OR found in various places as a very very rare drop

*If opening a crate and you are due to receive a duplicate item, there is a 33% chance it is re-rolled*

## BUGS
- !fish doesnt work unless u have !setfishdefault first

## QUALITY OF LIFE
 - Removing purple emoji from things that aren't so special (example: rustycap and mulchpocket)

 - Blingbox cooldown message / anti spam measures

 - `slots2autospinner`
   - you add charges to it by doing `!slots2autospinner charge`
   - a charge costs 1x `crusheddubloon`
   - a charge grants 200x autospins of slots2
   - to use, `!slots2autospinner 1000` will do 200 spins of bet size 1000. You pay the cost upfront, in this example the price would be 200k.
   - if you dont have the coins for 200x spins, or at least 1x charge, you wont be permitted to start
   - the spins will occur every 5 seconds, and will pause if you are in a FEECH
   - you cannot stop the 200x spins once it starts

## BALANCE
 - guild wearables buffed (example burlyvest 10% -> 12%)

## IDEAS / FEATURES
- Page on fishbot.app with widgets and stream and chat, a better way to play

## LONG TERM / PIE IN THE SKY
