# Master Sets

### Mechanics

Master sets come in master crates.

Master crate prices as follows:

== Item Sources ==
{{Item Drops
| Item Drops = {{Item Drop
| Image = Mine_Farganite_Ore.png
| Name = Mine Farganite Ore
| Skill = Mining
| Level = 50
| Quantity = 1
| Chance = 100%
}}  {{Item Drop
| Image = Spelunking.png
| Name = Spelunking
| Skill = Mining, Agility
| Level = 50, 50
| Quantity = 2-5
| Chance = 14.937%
}}  
}} 




## BUGS
- !fish doesnt work unless u have !setfishdefault first

## QUALITY OF LIFE
 - Removing purple emoji from things that aren't so special (example: rustycap and mulchpocket)

 - Blingbox cooldown message / anti spam measures

 - `slots2autospinner`
   - you add charges to it by doing `!slots2autospinner charge`
   - a charge costs 1x `crusheddubloon`
   - a charge grants 200x autospins of slots2
   - to use, `!slots2autospinner 1000` will do 200 spins of bet size 1000. You pay the cost upfront, in this example the price would be 200k.
   - if you dont have the coins for 200x spins, or at least 1x charge, you wont be permitted to start
   - the spins will occur every 5 seconds, and will pause if you are in a FEECH
   - you cannot stop the 200x spins once it starts

## BALANCE
 - guild wearables buffed (example burlyvest 10% -> 12%)

## IDEAS / FEATURES
- Page on fishbot.app with widgets and stream and chat, a better way to play

## LONG TERM / PIE IN THE SKY
- Widget above ported to iphone app / android app / windows app
- Fishbot bank u could use via website (deposit/withdraw) so ur inv can be managed/cleaned
