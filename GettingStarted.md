## Getting Started ##

Getting started in fishbot can be daunting.

Guide on commands/how to play at: https://fishbot.app/#/guide

This guide centers around a fast, effective and efficient start to a new account.

-----------------------------

You're a fresh account, a level 1 fisher, and you start with simply a starterrod

First:
- `!setteam tbow` or `!setteam scythe`. This will allow you to claim reward chests which spawn in the corner of the lake
- `!fish s` to send your first fish. The 's' indicates a short fish

# Early goals:

You can make money by selling the fish gained from fishing trips. Early on, you will need to upgrade your rod ASAP. So a `!sellallfish` after every fishing trip and `!coins` to see where you are at.

5000 gold: ![image](https://fishbot.app/items/oakrod.png) `oakrod`\
15000 gold: ![image](https://fishbot.app/items/willowrod.png) `willowrod`\
50000 gold: ![image](https://fishbot.app/items/maplerod.png) `maplerod`\
200000 gold: ![image](https://fishbot.app/items/yewrod.png) `yewrod`\
800000 gold: ![image](https://fishbot.app/items/magicrod.png) `magicrod`

A big essential is a `lockpick` (160000 gold) or a `minilockpick` (16000 gold, but can break). This will allow you to `!thieve barrel` which will start leveling your thieving and get you free fish/gold/items.

You want to look out for `barrelnote` and `otherbarrelnote` when thieving the barrel, these will unlock new thieve locations to fish from.

Once you start to catch and find anchovy, you can start training crafting by `!makemulch`. This uses up 25x anchovy but will get you 1x mulch in return. If you have found vials, level 7 crafting allows you to `!make craftingpotion`. If you find an eyehook, you can `!use pike` as another low level crafting training method.

Long term goals should always be to fish hard, upgrade your rod, lockpick and eventually wearable gear. 

Always check `!make?` to see if you have any new crafting recipes unlocked. It shows what you can craft with current craft level + inventory.

Its always good to check `!make?` after using a craftingpotion or supercraftingpotion. This will show you the highest items you cna craft.

Keep an eye out for `bova` corner event.. this will give you bova and berries which lead to early level craftable gear that you can wear. Its good to be familiar with all corner events found [here.](https://fishbotapp.github.io/fishbotwiki/CornerEvents/)

# Mid level goals:

As you ease out of being a beginner you will want to make sure you have an item in ever slot of your !gear. Thats head, chest, neck, legs, boots, eski, gloves and rod. Need to find something to occupy a slot? Check the [Item Database](https://fishbotapp.github.io/fishbotwiki/ItemDatabase/)

Also, ensure you have one piece of jewlery in your inv. An ammy, ring and anklet. These can be bought from the shop for 1.6-2m 

Gems Gems Gems.... very valuable to use.. sell.. and grant GREAT crafting exp.

Once you have jewlery, make sure you !use cut gems to enchant them. Each piece of jewlery can be buffed by up to +15% by adding 15 gems to it.

This is a good time to start checking !stats and obtaining items to buff rod speed, rod power and exp/fish gained. The in game shop offers a lot between items and rods for increasing your fish yields 

Its good to be aware of the three guilds (fishingguild, craftingguild and thievingguild). Entry to these guilds come at a big price bug grant *massive* buffs in their respective skill. Be aware of what the requirements to join are, and start to accumulate them.

# End game goals:

You should have joined all guilds and be accumulating guild currencies to buy the very powerful guild items.

You should be trying to accumulate all of the fish baits (mostly accumulated by gutting) to absolutely max your fishing buffs.

Your gear in each slot should be the best it can be, with what you have, for the activity you are doing. 

Start to stack items and tasks for when you get the right boosts, buffs and weather to truly capatalise.

Grind grind grind exp for higher level unlocks. Thieving levels unlock access to higher loot droptables while thieving, and increase chance for hitting the UDT.

The high level rods take a *lot* of money to purchase.. stack buffs and find your own meta for stacking up the coin! Whether that is lobbies, eels, crafting,  merching the market, gambling... whatever!

# The fishbot master:

Fill out every collection log you can

Aquire all salesman items

Try and get every pet....?

Stack fish and treat them like stocks for big market moves

Have you maxed your orbs? Thats a lot of orbcores...

Have you got the hearth yet? I hear thats 500m from the shop....
