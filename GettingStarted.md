Guide on commands/how to play at: https://fishbot.app/#/guide

This guide centers around a fast, effective and efficient start to a new account.

-----------------------------

You're a fresh account, a level 1 fisher, and you start with simply a starterrod

First:
- `!setteam tbow` or `!setteam scythe`. This will allow you to claim reward chests which spawn in the corner of the lake
- `!fish s` to send your first fish. The 's' indicates a short fish

Early goals:

You can make money by selling the fish gained from fishing trips. Early on, you will need to upgrade your rod ASAP. So a `!sellallfish` after every fishing trip and `!coins` to see where you are at.

5000 gold: `oakrod`\
15000 gold: `willowrod`\
50000 gold: `maplerod`\
200000 gold: `yewrod`\
800000 gold: `magicrod`

A big essential is a `lockpick` (160000 gold) or a `minilockpick` (16000 gold, but can break). This will allow you to `!thieve barrel` which will start leveling your thieving and get you free fish/gold/items.

You want to look out for `barrelnote` and `otherbarrelnote` when thieving the barrel, these will unlock new thieve locations to fish from.

Once you start to catch and find anchovy, you can start training crafting by `!makemulch`. This uses up 25x anchovy but will get you 1x mulch in return. If you have found vials, level 7 crafting allows you to `!make craftingpotion`. If you find an eyehook, you can `!use pike` as another low level crafting training method.

Long term goals should always be to fish hard, upgrade your rod, lockpick and eventually wearable gear. 

Always check `!make?` to see if you have any new crafting recipes unlocked. It shows what you can craft with current craft level + inventory.

Its always good to check `!make?` after using a craftingpotion or supercraftingpotion. This will show you the highest items you cna craft.

Keep an eye out for `bova` corner event.. this will give you bova and berries which lead to early level craftable gear that you can wear. Its good to be familiar with all corner events found [here.](https://fishbotapp.github.io/fishbotwiki/CornerEvents/)
