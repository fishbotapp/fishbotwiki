# Thieving #

Thieving is the art of targetting a known location, to extract items, coins or fish.

Each time you thieve:
- You must have a lockpick in your inventory
- You will need to wait 1 hour to thieve again, this is called thieving cooldown
- You have a chance of hitting the [Thieving Unique Droptable](./UDT.md)
- You have a chance of finding an uncut gem

With the right items:
- You can dramatically reduce your thieving cooldown
- You have a chance of 'double thieving', which hits the thieve location twice
- You have a chance of a 'cooldown reset', which means you are free to thieve again *immediately*!

The higher your thieve level:
- The faster you complete the thieve trip
- Findable items become better and more valuable
- Number of fish found increase in quantity and type
- The more chance you have of hitting the [Thieving Unique Droptable](./UDT.md)
- The more chance you have of finding a note, this grants you access to a new thieving location
